# blockens-metal

A version of my snake like game made with metal. This is a project I undertook to help me learn
the very basics of working with Metal.

In particular I learned how to work with buffers and textures, the render pipeline, vertex and fragment
shader basics.

## This game features:

* Generated terrain and stars that are different for each game.
* Reusable grid/tile logic for placing game pieces and decorations on screen.
* An animated sprite layer that takes advantage of the grid logic.
* A custom built font also using the grid logic, used to display the score.
* Parallel rendering, a varied use of different types of buffers.

## Controls:

* N - start a new game.
* P - pause current game.
* S - start paused game or start new game when game is over.
* Arrow keys move the snake.
